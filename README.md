Introduction to Stochastic Processes
A stochastic process is a mathematical model used to describe the evolution of a system over time in a random or probabilistic manner. It is represented by a collection of random variables indexed by time, often denoted as 
�
�
X 
t
​
  where 
�
t is the time parameter. Stochastic processes can be discrete or continuous and have various applications in understanding complex systems.

Algorithms
1. Algorithm A
Algorithm A is derived from the stochastic process equation and provides a simulation of the process based on certain parameters. The algorithm follows these steps:

Step 1: Initialize parameters and variables.
Step 2: Generate random numbers according to the desired probability distribution.
Step 3: Update the process using the derived equation based on the generated random numbers.
Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 to simulate the stochastic process for a specified number of time steps.
2. Algorithm B
Algorithm B is another simulation algorithm derived from the stochastic process equation, offering an alternative approach to modeling the process. It operates as follows:

Step 1: Set up initial conditions and parameters.
Step 2: Generate random variates from the required probability distribution.
Step 3: Use the derived equation to update the stochastic process based on the generated random variates.
Step 4: Iterate through the time steps and repeat steps 2 and 3 to simulate the process.
